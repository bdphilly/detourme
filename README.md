DetourMe
========

What is Detour Me?
----
Two people need to get somewhere. Both could drive. But why waste gas? One driver can pick up the other and drop him/her off. We want to choose the shortest detour distance to pick-up and drop-off the other person. Detour Me figures out the most efficient route! 

How it works: 
----
Right click (control + click) on the map to drop pins for drivers' starting/ending positions.

Technologies
----
JavaScript, jQuery, Google Maps Javascript API v3, Google Geocoding API, Bootstrap
